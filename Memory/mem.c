/*
 * How to use Dynamic Memory Allocation in Mellotron (an introduction to the Lazy Linear Allocation Method)
 * 
 * You should try to use DMA almost exclusively in block scopes; 
 * Use the memrec() function at the beginning of the block and the memunrec() function at the end: these will free all of the memory you allocated in the block.
 * 
 * Have a look at the other functions, they're pretty ez to understand. Yes, this method sucks. Can you do better? Bet you can.
